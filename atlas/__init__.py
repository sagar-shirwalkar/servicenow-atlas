"""ServiceNow Atlas — local-first AI knowledge layer for ServiceNow development.

Atlas is a Python package that bundles the two MCP servers, the bundle
build pipeline, and operational helpers. The name is a nod to the
Greek titan who carried the world on his shoulders: this package
carries the ServiceNow documentation and hands it to any AI agent
that speaks MCP.
